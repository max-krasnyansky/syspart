syspart (system partitioning) is a set of scripts for partitioning Linux systems
into domains (partitions) that can be used for different purposes. For example 
one partition can be used for the general purpose tasks and another for the
hard realtime applications.

Currently only two partitions are supporte: par0 and par1.
par0 is setup for running general purpose tasks, handling interrupts, etc. 
par1 is setup for running hard-rt tasks. CPUs in par1 are completely isolated.

See /etc/sysconfig/syspart for more details.

Do not forget to enable syspart service after installing this package.
	/sbin/chkconfig syspart on
